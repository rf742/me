<h1>A groff/troff/nroff Introduction with Annotated Bibliography - More information pending, still under construction! </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I thought I would make a short introduction to the nroff/troff/groff (in general -> roff)
document preparation system. It is an extremely lightweight alternative
to TeX. It has been around since the 70's and is still quite serviceable 
to write documents in. I want to provide a short introduction to the program, and an  annotated bibliography. 
Many of the works referenced are those written by the very people who created the system or worked with it when it was first developed.</p> 
<p>My motivation for this was that the information I needed in order to learn to use groff took considerably 
more scouring for compared to what I am used to when looking up information on software. 
I want to share this information with the hope that someone like me in the future stumbles upon this 
and saves themselves some time and frustration. I hope you enjoy learning about and using groff as much as I have.</p>
<p> A tutorial to composing documents with the system is forthcoming</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The first appearance of roff on a UNIX system was in 1970's at Bell Laboratories, written by Joseph Ossanna. 
The software was later rewritten by Brian Kernighan, and its capabilities were expanded beyond the particular 
hardware that Ossanna originally wrote troff for<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>If you have any experience with modern GNU/Linux systems, you are likely guessing that the name change from 
troff to groff means that it was rewritten under GNU, and you would be correct. James Clark reimplemented troff 
as groff and released it through GNU under the GNU GPL<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Today, the main use for groff is in writing man pages for UNIX and
linux systems. However, it can also be used to make papers, reports or even
books. In fact, much of the literature on groff has been written by <b>the</b> 
Brian Kernighan, and some of his books, including <em>The C Programming Language</em>, were typeset in troff.</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<p>The raw commands in groff are used sparingly, and similar to TeX, people have 
defined sets of macros which make the use of the software easier for the 
end user. There are a few different competing macro sets that can be
used with groff. Only one of these sets can be used at a time, and they
are picked via command line flags when compiling your groff document.</p>

<h2>Preprocessors</h2>
The different preprocessors for groff allow us to add components to our documents that are not just text. These include eqn for mathematical equations, chem for drawing chemical figures, pic for diagrams, tbl for inserting tables, and refer for managing references.

<!--
<h3>eqn</h3>
This allows us to add mathematical equations to our groff document.<br>

<code>

.EQ<br>
x bar = ( sum x sub i from i=1 to n ) over n<br>
.EN
</code>
<h3>pic</h3>

<h3>chem</h3>

<h3>tbl</h3>

<h3>refer</h3>

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>A basic command for groff might look like this:</p>
<code>groff -ms input -T pdf > output </code><br>

<p>This tells groff a few things.</p>
<ul>
  <li>-ms tells groff we are using the ms macros.</li>
  <li> input is the name of the file we are passing to groff</li>
  <li>-T pdf tells groff to output a pdf file. In place of pdf files we can also tell groff to give us other file types, such as dvi and ps. </li>
  <li>> output redirects the output stream to a file named output.</li>
</ul>
-->
<h2>Versions</h2>
<p>
Before we get to the bibliography, I just want to make
a quick statement about the different versions of this
software, as we have been using troff, groff, nroff,
and roff in a seemingly interchangeable manner. Groff
is the specific name for the GNU reimplementation
of troff that is found on virtually all modern systems.
Troff specifically refers to the typesetting version
of the UNIX version, whereas nroff is the term for
its typewriter counterpart. Groff is generally a
faithful reproduction of troff, and the vast majority
of behavior found in troff is exhibited in groff.
There are a few things worth noting. First, many
document formats which were particular to Bell 
Laboratories did not make it into the
GNU implementation of the macro packages. Second, there
are various slight functional differences, most of which
can be found on groff's man page.
</p>

<p>There are also more modern forks of groff in existence.
Utroff is a modern tool and macro set for troff. 
Heirloom Troff and Neatroff are implementations of
troff which carry improvements into the functionality of
the program. Most importantly, they bring the Knuth-Plass 
line-breaking algorithm, which represents a marked improvement
over the original one in troff.
A relatively recent macro package for groff is, mom, is still 
very much alive, and under active development. It is also extremely
well documented by its creator<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<p>
The vast majority of the material referenced in the
bibliography is specifically
talking about UNIX troff. However, most
of the material will still be accurate when working
with groff.

	<p class="annotation">This is the GNU troff manual. Great description of of the base program and the man and ms macros. However, it lacks documentation of mm, me, mdoc, and mom macro packages.</p>

	<p class="annotation">Paper explaining eqn by its creator. Note that this is a bit terse, and serves more of an exposition of what it is and how it was programmed, with sparse usable examples throughout.</p>
	
	<li>Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike. The UNIX Programming Environment. 1983. Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference.</li>
	<p class="annotation">Great book on UNIX. Has a chapter dedicated to document processing using troff.</p>

	<p class="annotation">Great write up of tbl by its creator. Has many different working examples within the text, so it works great not only as an introduction or reference, but also as a cookbook.</p>
	<p class="annotation">Also, it is worth noting that the volume which this paper is found in, the UNIX Programmer's Manual Volume 2, has a wealth of other roff related papers within it, so it is a good source for some other papers listed in this bibliography, if you can not find them on their own.</p>
	<li>Dale Dougherty, Tim O'Reilly. UNIX Text Processing. 1987. Hayden Books.</li>
	<p class="annotation">Absolutely fantastic. A book covering much more than just *roff.
	Chapters 4-6 cover troff itself,
	the ms macros, and the mm macros, respectively. Chapters 8.9, and 10 cover the preprocessors.
	The real gold is found in chapters 14-18 which go through the details of the system,
	including writing your own macros, and ending with you creating an external table of contents. 
	This is probably the best tutorial book in existence for *roff today.
