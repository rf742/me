<h1>Groff</h1>
<p>Groff is a pretty cool document preparation system. I have found much use for it as a
lightweight alternative to TeX or a word processor. It is built into most unix-like operating
systems (macOS, BSD, linux...) and is also available for windows.</p>
<p>It features very terse commands, and is ideal for not only interactive document writing, but
for use in generating automated reports, as it is processed in a single pass by the compiler, and
thus can be used in UNIX pipes.</p>

	that is a bibliography for resources concerning its use.</p>
