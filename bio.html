<h1>Biology</h1>
<p>This page will host some biology materials and links that I have created
or gathered over the years.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="files/apbionotes.pdf" target="_blank">Biology Notes</a></li>
These are a set of notes that I started creating while teaching a section
of AP Biology as a student teacher, I have been continually working on expanding
them and removing the dependency on the particular context of the course I was
teaching and the textbook I was using. These are still a work in progress.
