<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Before we can run groff, we must install groff. In order to do this, you will need one of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Linux/BSD system.</li>
<li>A Mac with homebrew installed.</li>
<li>A Windows 10 system with WSL installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these will provide access to groff. Note that mac, linux, and bsd systems generally come with
some form of groff installed. Do not use this package as is. Most linux distros refer to this preinstalled
system as 'groff-base' and it will not come with many of the related packages we need to use.</p>
<p>The following command is generally all that is needed on any linux system that uses apt:</p>
<code>
sudo apt install groff
</code>

<p>
This is also the same command to use if you are using WSL with Ubuntu.
If you are not using a distro that uses apt, refer to the documentation for the repositories for the correct package
name and install command.</p>
<p>If you are using mac, use homebrew to install it like this</p>
<code>
brew install groff gs
</code>
<p>This command also has you install ghostscript, which I have read (I can't confirm, I don't work on Mac) may be
necessary for generating PDFs with groff on Mac.</p>

<h2>Your First Groff Document</h2>
<p>In order to make a groff file, you need to use a text editor. Since this tutorial is teaching the ms macros,
we will name our file witht the extension .ms, which many programming oriented text editors will recognize and 
thus provide syntax highlighting. Let us start simple:</p>
<code>
.TL<br>
My Groff Document<br>
.AU<br>
John Doe<br>
.LP<br>
This will be the first sentence in my first paragraph.<br>
</code>
<p>Before we talk about what this command did, let us compile it first and see the output.</p>
<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>Next we will work directly with groff. Groff reads in structured plain text, and typesets it, and then writes it
directly to STDOUT. To capture the output, we can redirect it to a file, like this.</p>
<code>
groff -ms -T pdf mydoc.ms > mydoc.pdf
</code>
<p>This code is saying to run groff, use the ms macros, output to pdf, read in the file mydoc.ms, and store the output
in the file mydoc.pdf. Let's see what the PDF we generate looks like.</p>

<p>As we can see, the .TL command generated a title, which has been bolded and centered at the top of the page. The .AU
command has written the author's name italicized underneath the title. .LP is an acronym for "leading paragraph" and
gives us a paragraph without indentation. We can also add some more code to the file, using the .PP command, which
will start paragraphs with an indent.</p>
<p>Before we do this, there is something worth noting. All groff commands start with a period, and are at the beginning of
a line. This may seem barbaric to TeX users, but this has its advantages. Namely, it is trivial to write programs that will
do a single pass parse of a groff file. In fact, as we will see later, groff itself only performs a single pass, which 
limits its ability to do cross referencing, but leads to compilation being near instant, and allows piping into and out
of groff, which is impossible in TeX.</p>
