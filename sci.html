<h1>Science</h1>
<p>This page will host some science materials and links that I have created
or bookmarked over the years.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="files/apbionotes.pdf" target="_blank">AP Biology Notes</a></li>
These are a set of notes that I started creating while teaching a section
of AP Biology as a student teacher, I have been continually working on expanding
them and removing the dependency on the particular context of the course I was
teaching and the textbook I was using. These are still a work in progress.
