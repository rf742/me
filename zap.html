<h1><b>zap</b> and Electrostatics</h1>

<h2>Electrostatics</h2>

<p>Electrostatics is the field of physics dealing with electrical charges not in motion.
The most basic example of this, and one of the first encountered when seeing this topic
in introductory physics classes is that of point charges.</p>

<p>A point charge is an idealized body that has charge and takes up no volume. 
One on its own is boring, but the fun starts when we have multiple. We know
that opposite charges attract, and like charges repel. Electrostatics has the
tool of Coulombs's Law, which allows us to compute the forces between different
point charges in a system.</p>
<h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
<p>The law governing the force between point charges (Coulomb's Law) is given as:

\[F_e = k{q_1q_2 \over r^2}\]
<ul>
<li>Where \(F_e\) is the force between two particles</li>
<li>\(q_1, q_2\) are the charges of the two particles.</li>
<li>and \(r^2\) is the square of the distance bewteen them.</li>
	
</ul>


</p>
<h3>A simple, 1D example</h3>

<h3>3 charges, 1D example</h3>

<h3>3 charges, 2D example</h3>

<h3>3D?</h3>

<h3>Increasing the number of charges</h3>
<p>As you keep adding more and more charges, the work gets very tedious rather
quickly. Think about it. If I add a fourth charge to one of our worked
examples, I need to now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add the effect of the 4th charge to the net force on each of the other three.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, I need to compute the effects of charges 1,2, and 3 on the 4th.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this by hand gets silly as we add even more charges. While doable, it
gets quite tedious.</p>

<h3>zap</h3>
<p>If you do want to calculate the effects of a large number of particles on
each other, one of the best ways to avoid the tedium and simple errors that
come with this repetitive computation is to ask a computer to do it for you.
One such program is <i>zap</i>, a program I have written. Please check out the
github page for it if you are interested in it
